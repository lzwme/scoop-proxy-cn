  "description": "Nemu64 is one of the oldest Nintendo 64 emulators in existance. For a long time it was also nearly unplayable due to being to slow for most PCs to run. Fortunately as both Nemu64 and the development of faster multi-Ghz CPU's progressed, Nemu64 can be played without much slowdown.",
