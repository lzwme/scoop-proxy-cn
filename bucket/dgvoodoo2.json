    "Basically, you take the DLLs for whatever API you need to convert and copy them to the directory of the application you want to run - usually where the EXE file is located, otherwise where you find other DLL files.",

    "If you want to create a unique configuration for a particular app, use the Add button up to the right in dgVoodoo's control panel.",
    "",
    "This will create a configuration file in the selected directory, and you can then use the drop-down list at the top of the window to choose which one to configure.",
    "",
    "If an app doesn't have a configuration file, it will use the one found in AppData.",
    "",
    "IMPORTANT: Remember to copy the corresponding DLL files again whenever dgVoodoo is updated; the settings set in the control panel only applies to the DLLs of the current version!",
