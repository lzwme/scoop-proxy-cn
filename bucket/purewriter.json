    "- Pure Writer Desktop 1.4.0 version must be used with Pure Writer 19.92.0 or above.",

    "- During the development of this desktop version, I have encountered some situations that will cause the current article on Pure Writer Android to be emptied. Although this problem has been fixed, I am not completely sure if some scenes may trigger this again. But don't worry, because Pure Writer for Android supports multiple Backups. You can recover/restore it by using 'History' or 'Undo'. More about automatic backup and cloud backup: <https://writer.drakeet.com/backups>"
