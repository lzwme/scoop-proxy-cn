  "description": "BletchMAME is a new experimental front end for MAME. Unlike existing front ends (which function as launchers, keeping MAME's internal UI), BletchMAME replaces the internal MAME UI with a more conventional point and click GUI to provide a friendlier experience in a number of areas (such as profiles, input configuration and a number of others). While BletchMAME is intended to support all machines supported by MAME, it should be particularly suitable to computer emulation. ",
