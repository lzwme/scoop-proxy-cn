    "winapp2ool has its own update mechanism, and said updates are not pushed to Releases.",
    "Therefore, I have disabled Scoop autoupdate and marked the version 1.4+ as it is on GitHub.",
    "If not existing- a default winapp2.ini is created with save/read \"settings from disk\" turned on.",
    "Do note it does all operations (including updates) from working directory by default- so when using the shim it",
    "won't load settings or logs from \"$dir\" unless you're residing in there.",
    "I recommend using the shim only for direct command-line operations.",
    "Use included app shortcut for updating and UI operations.",
    "If reinstalled with Scoop (after having updated), persisted winapp2.ini may cause issues with older build.",
    "Fix at your leisure!"
