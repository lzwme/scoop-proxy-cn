    "If the build fails, make sure the required toolchains for rustup exist.",
    "If you installed rustup via scoop, the default toolchain is MSVC which can be downloaded here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/",
    "For more information on this, see the notes of rustup by running 'scoop info rustup'.",
    "Alternatively, refer to https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows.html for directions on using the GNU toolchain instead."
