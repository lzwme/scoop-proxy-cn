  "description": "Project64k is a modified version of the Nintendo 64 emulator, Project64 1.4. It was originally created by Hotquik and is currently developed by Smasherx74. As a Nintendo 64 emulator, the program has the ability to run Super Smash Bros., as well as a majority of the Nintendo 64's library. Unless the user has an N64 controller adapter for PC, they will generally be using a keyboard to play. (Core 2.2 releases: https://github.com/Ownasaurus/Project64k-Core-2.2/releases)",
